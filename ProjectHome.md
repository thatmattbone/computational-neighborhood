# Computational Neighborhood #

Computational Neighborhood, or CN, is a Java based research and teaching framework for distributed parallel computing. CN provides a compelling alternative to existing message passing frameworks like MPI by eliminating painful administration tasks and providing a simplified programming interface.

## Rewrite ##

The original version of CN has been abandoned.  Currently a simpler, more modern rewrite is in progress.

For information on old versions of CN see HistoricalVersions.
