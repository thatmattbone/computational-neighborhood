# Getting the Client API #
The CN client API is not only distributed as a standalone binary, but is also available from a Maven repository.

### Adding CN to your pom.xml ###

## Non-Maven Users ##
If you are uncomfortable with Maven or would like to use a different build system, you can.  Simply download the CN bundle.  The client API is stored in the `cn-client` directory.  Add this jar file to your classpath.  The client API dependencies are stored in the `cn-client/lib` directory.  You will need to add these to your classpath, too (unless they're already there because of a pre-existing dependency of your application).
