# Historical Versions #

The old version of computational neighborhood can be checked out of subversion with:

```
  svn checkout http://neighborhood.googlecode.com/svn/trunk cn-deprecated
```

All development in the subversion repository has stopped.  New development is occurring in the mercurial repository, however, the old code has not been pulled over.

An old binary version can be downloaded [here](http://neighborhood.googlecode.com/files/cn-everything-0.00.3.bz2)
